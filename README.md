to be removed once ive found a collaborator to work with


I have completed all parts of the homework but havent been able to find a collaborator as i 
started on the homework later in the week due to work. I will continue to email my fellow students 
until the due time. I did post in the discussions board on canvas for our class in search of a partner but 
as of now, 2/26/2024 @ 1:34am, i have not secured a collaborator.

Thanks,
